III. IDE PyCharm:
===================
1. Different IDEs in market 
   IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a place where programmers can create their own applications by writing the code.
   Normally the IDEs come with debuggers and compilers, which makes the work of programmers much easier. It is a single software 
   in which all parts of development are done. In earlier days the IDEs started with terminals and consoles, but later they have 
   changed a lot due to user needs. Nowadays the IDEs are much more developed, they use machine learning to autocomplete our code 
   and also provide suggestions while we are struck or face any issues.

1. IntelliJ IDEA
   It is written in Java and is one of the most user-friendly IDEs available for coding. It mainly aims at productivity and user 
   experience. It gives relevant suggestions while you are coding. It has integrated version control systems and it supports many 
   languages. It has smart code completion which suggests the names of classes and methods while we are coding. It does not require
   the use of any external plugins. Intellij IDEA easily supports a lot of developer tools. But the one among few disadvantages is 
   that the performance is not up to the mark in low-end devices.

2. Visual Studio
   It is an IDE from Microsoft and is used to develop websites, web apps, and mobile apps. It has a wide functioning which allows it 
   to develop almost anything. It also supports IntelliSense coding for C++. It can be used in both Windows and MAC and allows us to
   create applications for any platform. It enables us to test apps and correct errors on the go. Visual Studio is available for free. 
   Visual Studio comes with its own search engine which allows to search for the features of Visual Studio. The Team Foundation Server 
   feature of Visual Studio is also very nice, it allows the user to have a checkpoint and roll back to the previous version. But the 
   problem with Visual Studio is that it is a heavy software and takes a very long time to load.

3. Eclipse
   It is developed by the Eclipse Foundation. It functions by having a base workspace and an extensible plugin environment where we can
   download and customize the workspace available. It supports debugging and profiling. It has a drag and drop functionality and allows 
   us to analyze the code using static analysis. If you are comfortable in eclipse IDE, you can code in any famous language like Python,
   Java, and C++. The OS supports for this IDE are Windows, Linux, and macOS. Eclipse is available for free to use.

4. PyCharm
   PyCharm is an IDE developed by JetBrains specifically for Python. It is best known for smart code completion, code inspections, 
   on-the-fly error highlighting, and very quick fixes. It helps us to write neat and maintainable code. It also offers great support
   for using frameworks like Django, Flask, Google App Engine, etc. It integrates with the IPython Notebook and we can also use 
   scientific packages like Numpy and Matplotlib. PyCharm IDE is free to use. The OS supports for this IDE are Windows, macOS, and Linux.

5. Atom
   Atom is mainly used for web development. It is developed by GitHub. Atom is founded by GitHub’s founder Chris Wanstrath. It is a 
   hundred percent free and open source. It is cross-platform and used for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is highly customizable and
   has many useful plugins. The main advantage with Atom is that it has an attractive interface, good color-coded syntax. But the 
   disadvantage is that it suffers from high start-up time.

6. Arduino IDE
   Arduino is an IDE written in C and C++. It is mainly used to upload codes to Arduino boards. It supports almost all microcontroller 
   development boards available in the market today. The code in Arduino is in the cloud so we can use it everywhere. Arduino IDE accepts
   C and C++ languages because most of the device’s libraries are written in C++. But most of the underlying system of the Arduino is not
   object-oriented so it uses both C and C++.

7. NetBeans
   NetBeans is developed by Apache Software Foundation and Oracle. It is an IDE for Java. It allows applications to be developed from 
   components called modules. It is owned by the company which owns Java, so the support for Java developers would be excellent here.
   Moreover, it is the official IDE for Java 8. It allows the users to build desktop, mobile, and web applications. The advantage of
   NetBeans is that the autocomplete feature is very much useful and running the server application is very simple in NetBeans, but the
   disadvantage is that it takes a lot of time to start.

8. AWS Cloud9
   It is developed by Amazon. It is an online IDE. AWS Cloud9 supports various programming languages like C, C++, Python, JavaScript,
   etc. It is very easy to access AWS Cloud9 and collaborate. It allows us to run the development environment on a managed Amazon EC2
   instance or other Linux servers available. In AWS Cloud9 we can also simulate the terminal with Linux commands, allowing parallel 
   development for various developers. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to choose the instance for a project.

9. Code::Blocks
   It is developed by the Code::Blocks team. Code::Blocks is written in C++. It is open-source software. Code::Blocks support many 
   compilers like GCC and Visual C++. It is very extensible and configurable. It is one of the best IDE for C and C++. The GNU GCC 
   compiler of Code::Blocks is very fast and highly scalable. Code::Blocks is very easy to use for beginners. Code::Blocks offer more
   flexibility and it is great as an open-source IDE. The disadvantage with Code::Blocks is that the design seems a bit dull.

10.Jupyter Notebook
   Jupyter Notebook, not actually a full-fledged IDE, is an open-source web-based application. It is widely used in data science, 
   scientific computing, and machine learning. It is widely used with Python but it supports other languages as well. It is also used
   as a presentation or educational tool. It also supports markdowns, so that we can add HTML components, audio, video, etc. It is
   founded by Fernando Perez and Brian Granger.

2. Advantages of IDE
   Advantages
1. IDE’s can be used to create software applications, drivers and utilities.
2. It allows developing software in any programming language without spending much time on language syntax.
3. IDE has the ability to correct syntaxes, gives a warning about memory leaks, assist in writing quality of code, etc.
4. It has increased efficiency, where you can code faster with less effort, and its features help organise resources, prevent mistakes, and provide shortcuts.
5. It supports collaboration, in which a group of programmers can easily work together within an IDE.
6. It provides program resources that are easy.
7. When creating applications, IDE manages resources such as library files, header files, etc., at specified locations.
8. This includes pre-installed libraries for a specific programming language.
9. That makes development easier by using syntax highlight features.
10.It makes the creation of database applications easily.
11.They provide services to sort, search, retrieve and process data in the database.
12.IDE’s can able to translate code from high-level languages to the object code of the targeted platform at the compile or build stage.
13.It helps to keep track of the code, generates code and allows searching.
